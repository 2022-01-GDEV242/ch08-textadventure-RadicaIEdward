B level elements
1. Add items to game, each room has one item. Each item has a description and weight, but I also included a name. When printing room info, items are included.

2. Make it so rooms can hold multiple items

3. Implemented Back Command (One room only)

4. I also implemented a Player class that can carry one or more objects so that I could implement other player stuff later.

A Level elements

1. Implemented a VERY rudimentary health system.

2. Eat increases health.

3. I'm hoping the extra credit and the 4 things I implemented in the B level
will help cover this missing A spot, ha ha.

Extra Credit.

1. Implemented Take command

2. Implemented Drop command
